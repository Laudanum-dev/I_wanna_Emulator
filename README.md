# I_wanna_Emulator
Fangame physics emulation
---
Unfinished. Contains code related to solids (including moving solids) and all sorts of related things.
You can compile the project (you'll have to install and link raylib to the project), and you'll see a small demo, 
featuring player, some solid rectangles, one-way walls and moving versions of those.
